									<p><h2>Hey, Welcome! :3</h2></p>
									<p>So, the Furry Fandom (FF; not to be confused with Final Fantasy. :P) has been a big part of my life ever since I was 16. I was on Xbox one day and saw a guy with a Furry GamerPic. I instantly wanted to message him and ask him what it was about. Come to my surprise he was a furry. I didn't know anything about the Furry Fandom at this point in my life, so I did a bit of research on my iPod Touch.</p>
									<p>I had found out that the Furry Fandom was just a fanbase of a group of people who are interested in Anthropomorphic Animals; Otherwise known as Animals who are mainly bipedal and walk on two legs; There are Furries who are Quadropedic and walk on four legs, but thats a whole another story.</p>
									<p>Once I did more research on the topic of the FF, I found that they're a very diverse group of individuals who all love to express themselves in various ways! Some might portray themselves as Bunnies, Cats, Dragons, Snakes, Canines, Birds, etc.</p>
