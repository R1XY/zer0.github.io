											</header>
											<p>In my life, I have met some pretty amazing people. One of which has inspired me to study Cyber Security. I have been in and out of Cyber Security for around 8 years now, as of 2022. I started back in 2014 when I was in college, and it took off from there. I learned a lot, from LFI's; RCE's; Buffer Overflows; Simple Reverse Shells, and the likes.</p>

											</header>
											<p>This hobby of mine is my most recent hobby I've picked up. It started back when I was living with my Best Friend, in his Garage and we both had the idea to make a game together. I picked up the hobby and started messing with Unreal Engine 4. I have a few ideas for games in my mind few of which being Horror; Adventure; and Open World.</p>

											</header>
											<p>I have been in the Furry Fandom for just about 11 years now. Ever since around 2012 when I found the Furry Fandom, I fell in love with the idea, and the people in it, and have been in it ever since.<br />FUN FACT: It took me up until 2 years ago to actually make my Fursona! That means I couldn't think of one for 9 years! :O</p>

											</header>
											<p>Photography has been a big part of my life since 2019. I have my younger brother to thank for getting me into photography, due to his want to be a YouTuber. He ended up buying a camera and showing it off to me, I pretty much starting loving photography ever since then.</p>
